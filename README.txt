there might be bugs around so use at your own risk...
please report bugs in discord, or I might not notice it for months, you can also use https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PC7Id8WjQnhYUFQsf9aG2PfoE__qt2ETfAAK76ERvxo/viewform to report minor bugs and other issues if you so prefer.

Upgrading to super is encouraged. It probably helps to keep the Doodle or Die servers running, I don't know how is the site even running anymore, but I'm not really connected with the real devs and this works offline anyways.

shrinking the drawing area should slightly reduce lag if it is noticeable
turning invisible the layers that you don't need visible at the moment should also reduce lag. They should, however, be made visible again if you wish to post them.

doodle saves a backup 20 seconds after the last stroke and when closing the window
