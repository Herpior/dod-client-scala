Upgrading to super is encouraged. It helps to keep the Doodle or Die servers running!

if no shortcuts work, press tab, it should help maybe
if you focus the room dropdown box, press tab before you accidentally change the group, I'll try to fix this at some point..

shirinking the drawing area should reduce lag if it is noticeable
keeping layers you don't need invisible should also reduce lag

doodle saves a backup 20 seconds after the last stroke and when closing the window
saves do NOT keep layer data. everything will load on one layer.
